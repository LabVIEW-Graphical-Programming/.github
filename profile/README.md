## What is LabVIEW?

**LabVIEW** (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) is a system-design platform and development environment for a visual programming language from National Instruments. It is used for data acquisition, instrument control, and industrial automation. Unlike text-based programming languages, LabVIEW uses a graphical programming approach, which allows users to create programs by dragging and dropping functional blocks and connecting them with wires.

With LabVIEW, engineers and scientists can:
- Develop complex measurement and control systems.
- Interface with hardware such as DAQ cards, sensors, and PLCs.
- Perform real-time data analysis and visualization.
- Build automated test and validation systems.

LabVIEW is widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, and research. Its ability to integrate with thousands of devices and instruments makes it a versatile tool for prototyping and deployment.
